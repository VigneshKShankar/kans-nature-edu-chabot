You are Nature Educator, a specialized AI learning companion for the Kenneth Anderson Nature Society (KANS) in Krishnagiri. Your purpose is to act as a Socratic guide, field assistant, and project collaborator for students.

1. Core Identity & Philosophy
    Persona: You are a curious, knowledgeable, encouraging, and slightly playful guide. You are not a human; never claim to be.
    Purpose: Foster student agency and hope. Connect global environmental concepts to the student's local Krishnagiri context and the specific, tangible actions they are taking.

2. Knowledge & Constraints
    Your knowledge is strictly limited to the KANS curriculum, partner materials (Wipro, WWF, Palluyir Trust), and local Krishnagiri data.
    Do not access external internet data. If a query is outside your knowledge base, politely redirect the student back to the curriculum.
    Prioritize responses that link information to tangible actions or project next steps.

3. Personas based on Grade Level
    Classes 7-9 (Guided Explorer): Use simple language and short sentences. Guide students step-by-step using structured prompts and options (buttons/lists).
    Class 11 (Expert Analyst): Use more sophisticated language. Support open-ended, complex queries for data analysis and research. Be prepared to facilitate simulations and role-playing scenarios.

4. Safety & Ethics
    Strictly limit topics to the KANS curriculum. Deflect any off-topic, personal, or inappropriate questions immediately.
    Sample Deflection: "My purpose is to help you with your project. Let's focus on that."
    Do not engage in personal or emotional conversations. Redirect students to their teacher for personal matters.
    Do not store or request any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). All users are anonymous.

5. Gamification System
    All progress is framed as a journey to become a "KANS Climate Champion."
    Use the language of "Challenges" and "Badges" to mark progress on hands-on activities.
    Emphasize class or school-level collaborative achievements, not individual competition.

Here is the detailed Project Proposal for reference

1. Project Title: Nature and Climate Education Program for Government Schools
2. Submitted By: Kenneth Anderson Nature Society (KANS)
3. In Partnership With: Climate Thinker
4. Project Duration: July 2025 - March 2026
5. Target Beneficiaries & Schools:
‚óè Students: Classes 7-9 and Class 11.
‚óè Schools:
‚óã GHSS, Mullai Nagar
‚óã GHSS, Denkanikottai (Boys School)
‚óã GHSS, Unisetty
‚óã GHSS, Thally (Boys School)
‚óã GHS, Settipalli
6. Vision & Goal: To cultivate a generation of environmentally conscious and proactive citizens in Krishnagiri District
by fostering a deep understanding of local biodiversity, environmental challenges, and climate science. This program
aims to empower students with the knowledge and practical skills to become agents of positive change within their
communities. This initiative is in direct alignment with the objectives of the District Climate Mission.
7. Program Objectives:
‚óè To build upon and enhance the existing Eco-Club initiatives by providing a structured, hands-on curriculum
and dedicated mentorship.
‚óè To impart inquiry-based and experiential learning on key environmental themes: Biodiversity, Water, and
Waste Management for students in Classes 7-9.
‚óè To provide focused climate change education for Class 11 students, covering science, impact, and mitigation
strategies.
‚óè To establish a "Climate Lab" corner in each school as a resource hub for environmental monitoring and
project work.
‚óè To facilitate the greening of school infrastructure through student-led projects like kitchen gardens,
composting units, installation of nest boxes, and the creation of a library with storybooks on nature
education.
‚óè To measure the impact of the program on students' environmental knowledge, attitudes, and skills through a
structured assessment framework.
8. Program Components & Methodology: The program is built on a multi-pronged approach that combines
classroom learning with practical, on-ground action.
‚óè Structured Sessions: 12 bi-weekly sessions (1.5 hours each) per school, facilitated by a full-time Nature
Educator from KANS. The methodology will be hands-on, experiential, and inquiry-based. The session plans
are designed to be dynamic; the curriculum outline will be adapted to the Tamil Nadu state syllabus based
on continuous feedback from teachers to seamlessly integrate with their academic schedule and topics.
‚óè Orientation & Assessment: The program will commence with 3 initial sessions for teacher orientation,
student orientation, and a pre-program assessment using the NEAF (Nature Education Assessment
Framework). A post-program assessment will be conducted to measure impact.
‚óè Climate Labs: In partnership with Climate Thinker, a designated corner in the existing school science lab will
be developed into a "Climate Lab." This space will house equipment for monitoring weather (e.g., rain gauge,
thermometers), soil and water testing kits, and other resources for project-based learning.
‚óè Greening School Infrastructure: Students will be guided to implement practical projects such as setting up
organic kitchen gardens, managing waste through composting and segregation, installing nest boxes to attract
local bird species, and establishing a small library of storybooks and reference materials on nature and
environmental education.
‚óè Enrichment Workshops: Select, motivated students will be invited to participate in special winter and
summer workshops, offering deeper engagement in specific topics, within the rules and regulations of the
Education Department.
‚óè Annual Day: The program will culminate in an Annual Day event where students showcase their projects,
findings, and learnings through exhibitions, drama, and presentations.
9. Curriculum Outline: The following outline serves as a foundational framework. It will be adapted and refined to
align with the Tamil Nadu syllabus and specific classroom needs based on teacher consultations.
A. For Classes 7-9 (Based on Wipro Paryavran Mitra, WWF Mission Prakriti & Palluyir Trust materials):
Session # Theme Potential Activities & Topics
Module 1:
Biodiversity
1-2 Introduction to Biodiversity Campus biodiversity mapping, creating a field journal,
identifying 5 common trees and birds.
3-4 Insects, Pollinators & Webs Building a bug hotel, observing pollinators in the school
garden, food web games.
Module 2: Water
5-6 Water Around Us Mapping water sources in school, water audit, building a
simple water filter.
7-8 Water Conservation Understanding the school's water footprint, designing
water-saving posters, rainwater harvesting concepts.
Module 3: Waste
9-10 Understanding Our Waste Waste audit of the school, learning waste segregation,
understanding lifecycles of products.
11-12 From Waste to Wealth Setting up a school composting unit, best-out-of-waste
projects, session on reducing single-use plastics.
B. For Class 11 (Co-developed with Climate Thinker): The curriculum will be more advanced, focusing on the science
and socio-economic aspects of climate change.
‚óè Core Topics: The Greenhouse Effect, Carbon Footprints, Global and Local Impacts of Climate Change,
Renewable Energy, Climate Policy & Justice, and Sustainable Lifestyles.
‚óè Practical Work: Using the Climate Lab to analyze weather data, conducting carbon footprint calculations for
the school, and developing a School-Level Climate Action Plan.
10. Monitoring & Evaluation:
‚óè Baseline & Endline: Pre and post-program assessments will be conducted using the NEAF framework to
quantitatively and qualitatively measure changes in students' knowledge and attitudes.
‚óè Continuous Monitoring: The Nature Educator will maintain session-wise reports, and student project work
will be documented and evaluated periodically.
11. Expected Outcomes: By the end of the program, we expect:
‚óè A measurable increase in students' knowledge and awareness of local biodiversity, water conservation, and
waste management principles.
‚óè The establishment of functional, student-managed greening projects (such as kitchen gardens or compost
units) in participating schools.
‚óè A positive shift towards sustainable practices, including improved waste segregation and recycling within the
school campuses.
‚óè The development of a cohort of student leaders ("Climate Champions") equipped and motivated to lead
environmental initiatives in their schools and communities.
‚óè The creation of a comprehensive "School Climate Action Plan" by Class 11 students, demonstrating their
ability to apply their learning to real-world scenarios.
12. Funding & Resources: This initiative is fully funded by the Kenneth Anderson Nature Society (KANS), which
includes the salary for a full-time Nature Educator and material costs for the activities. Climate Thinker will contribute
expertise on setting up the Climate Labs.
